  /*
	 
	In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of 
	well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is encipherment. 
	 
	To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. 
	In common parlance, "cipher" is synonymous with "code", 
	as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; 
	 
	However, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.

	Codes generally substitute different length strings of character in the output, 
	while ciphers generally substitute the same number of characters as are input. 
	
	There are exceptions and some cipher systems may use slightly more, or fewer, 
	characters when output versus the number that were input.
