  /*
   
   Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, 
   is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
   
   It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter 
   some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
   For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 
   The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

    The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, 
    such as the VigenÃ¨re cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. 

    As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice 
    offers essentially no communications security.
