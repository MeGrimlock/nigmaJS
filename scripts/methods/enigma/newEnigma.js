  /* Enigma Machine - German WWII
    
    ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine

    The Enigma machine is an encryption device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, 
    diplomatic and military communication. It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, in all branches of the German military.
    
    Enigma has an electromechanical rotor mechanism that scrambles the 26 letters of the alphabet. In typical use, 
    one person enters text on the Enigmaâ€™s keyboard and another person writes down which of 26 lights above the keyboard 
    lights up at each key press. If plain text is entered, the lit-up letters are the encoded ciphertext. 
    Entering ciphertext transforms it back into readable plaintext. 

    The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the keys and the lights with each keypress.
    The security of the system depends on Enigma machine settings that were changed daily, based on secret key lists distributed in advance, 
    and on other settings that change for each message. 
    
    Additional info on rotors: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_rotor_details
    
    The receiving station has to know and use the exact settings employed by the transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message.
    
    PS: One of the most famous encryption "methods" ever, it is my pleasure to enclude it in the module. 
    Disclaimer: All functions here were based on the works of :http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/enigma-cipher/ and adapted to ES6
    and CLass format. Thanks for your work, I couldn't have done this without your code :)
